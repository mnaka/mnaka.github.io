        		<h1>BonDS: Batter on Deck Sircle</h1>
    		</div><!-- /.blurb -->
    		<p>In 2004, Barry Bonds was walked a record 232 times.
    		That's about 3.95 miles. The man walked almost four miles to first base. In one year.
    		It's facts like these that leave no room for questioning the ability of Barry Bonds.</p>
    		<p>...</p>

    		<p>Or is there? </p>
    		<p>How many of those miles were actually because Barry Bonds was so greatly feared
    		And how many of them were due to inadequate protection behind him?</p>

    		<p>Enter Edgardo Alfonzo. Barry Bonds' protection in 2004. Though he certainly had a respectable career,
    		Alfonzo never quite had to same level of intimidating success that Bonds had.</p>

    		<p>The BonDS statistic aims to isolate the contributions of players not even in fair territory. The on deck circle.</p>
